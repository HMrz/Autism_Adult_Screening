# Autism_Adult_Screening

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. 

The Department of Digital Technology at the Manukau Institute of Technology in Auckland, New Zealand has proposed a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 19 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, they record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.

This Jupyter notebook will use machine learning algorithms to predict ASD.
